## Purpose
This project is the brain child of Chris, who is coming from a background in cabinetry and worked for many shops that struggle to have a firm grasp on pricing for their products. During his tenure at his most recent employer, he was tasked with developing a pricing tool that made proposals much easier and faster for designers to produce. Since Excel was the only reasonable tool he was familiar with, he built that pricing tool using Excel. He has been dreaming of producing a web application for cabinet shops that would serve the same purpose and much more, but without the limitations of Excel. This project is essentially our attempt to provide a proof of concept for that dream.
